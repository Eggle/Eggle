      <p>The only method that works 100% is using your Campsite with an Amiibo Card. <em>This only works if you have the maximum of 10 villagers.</em></p>
      </p>You will have to scan the Amiibo Card 3 days in a row and complete requests for your camper each day.  On the third day, they will ask to move in and prompt you on who to kick out.</p>
      <p>Without using Amiibo Cards, it is still possible to get a villager to move out, but it is tricky and mostly random.  <b>Baby Seal#3407</b> on discord has been kind enough to write this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15YCtSfoLQUfIzzgidmQU0whWNm-71-7Kpr-kcXerd4c/edit">guide</a> on moving out villagers.  Please understand that this takes patience.</p>
